#  Color Bullet (Game Jam Project)

Welcome to **Color**, a fast-paced **top-down shooting game** developed for a Game Jam with the theme **"Color"**. In this unique twist on the shooter genre, your weapon changes based on the **color absorbed from enemy blood**, turning combat into a chaotic and strategic dance of survival and adaptability.

---

## Game Concept

In **Color**, every kill counts — not just for survival, but for **changing your arsenal**. As you move through pools of enemy blood, your character absorbs **colors** that dynamically transform your **weapon type**. Each color corresponds to a unique bullet type with its own mechanics and combat style.

## Weapon Types by Color

- **Red – Explosive Bullets**  
  - High-damage, area-of-effect shots that detonate on impact.  
  - Great for clearing crowds but dangerous up close.

- **Orange – Shotgun Blast**  
  - Fires a powerful cone of pellets that knocks the player **backward**.  
  - Excellent for close quarters and mobility-based dodging.

- **Green – Sniper Shot**  
  - Charged precision shots that can **pierce multiple enemies**.  
  - Requires timing and aim, but devastating when used right.

> *The color of your bullets depends on the **blood color of the enemies you've recently walked through.***
